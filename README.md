# Project Overview

## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate the utilisation of Python, SQL, and R for proficient data preparation. It focuses on cleaning and structuring data to analyse inpatient ward experiences with healthcare providers. The project will demonstrate how these tools can be effectively employed to extract valuable insights from the survey data [collected](https://github.com/Md-Khid/Data_Wrangling_Patient_Survey_Experience/tree/main/Survey%20Data). Additionally, it will exhibit the creation of a simple Linear Model to predict patients' overall experience and the design of a performance-impact chart using only R's plot(), points(), text(), axis(), and abline() functions.

## Dataset Information

### Data Variables
The survey dataset for the entire year is stored in twelve separate Microsoft Excel documents, one for each calendar month. The significant part of the survey focuses on the experiences of warded patients with their doctors, including aspects such as respect, competency, empathy, and listening skills.

# Project Overview

## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate the utilisation of Python, SQL, and R for proficient data preparation. It focuses on cleaning and structuring data to analyse inpatient ward experiences with healthcare providers. The project will demonstrate how these tools can be effectively employed to extract valuable insights from the survey data collected. Furthermore, it will showcase the generation of a simple Linear Model and the design of a performance-impact chart using only R's plot(), points(), text(), axis() and abline() functions.
